# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 700 characters (target)
**Overlap:** 150 characters (target, using complete paragraphs)

The `city_guides` corpus contains long, sectioned guides rather than short
posts: the documents are roughly 1,500–2,500 characters long, and their
practical facts are usually contained in paragraphs. I use paragraph-aware
chunks with a 700-character target so a chunk can hold several related facts
without becoming a whole guide. A 150-character overlap retains the previous
short section when it fits, preserving context at a section boundary without
repeating most of the next chunk. Paragraphs are never split; an unusually long
paragraph is kept whole so a fact is not separated from its qualifier.

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `guide_givens_mill.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
# Givens Mill

Givens Mill is a village of 700 built around a working watermill that still grinds flour commercially. It is the sort of place people visit for an afternoon and then talk about for longer than the visit lasted.

## Getting there

No station and no bus on Sundays; four buses a day from Brightwater on weekdays, taking 30 minutes. Driving is 20 minutes. The village car park holds about forty cars and is full by 11am on summer Saturdays.

## Getting around

Everything is on one street along the river. The mill is at one end and the church at the other, eight minutes apart. The riverside path continues in both directions for as far as you want to walk.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `guide_regional_transport.md#1` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
## Buses

Three operators run in the region and they do not accept each other's tickets,
which is the single most common source of confusion for visitors. Services
concentrate on weekday daytimes. Sunday service is minimal to non-existent
outside the Brightwater town routes.

The Kestrelford service is hourly on weekdays, two-hourly on Saturdays, and
does not run on Sundays. The Halden Bay coast service runs four times daily
year-round.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `guide_eating.md#1` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
## Opening hours

This catches visitors out more than anything else. Outside Marchwood, kitchens
across the region stop serving at 9pm and often earlier. Kestrelford's pubs
serve 12 to 2 and 6 to 8:30 and there is nowhere to eat at all outside those
windows. Elder Ness has one pub, closed Mondays.

Sunday evening is the hardest meal to find anywhere except Marchwood and
Thornby Wells.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `guide_accessibility.md#3` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
## Practical

The nearest full hospital is in Marchwood. Brightwater has a hospital;
Kestrelford, Halden Bay, Corry Vale, Givens Mill and Elder Ness have minor
injuries units with limited hours or nothing at all.

Mobile coverage is good in the town centres and patchy on the outskirts, and
genuinely absent in parts of Corry Vale.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `guide_walking.md#3` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
## Seasonal notes

Add four minutes to any Brightwater walking estimate in winter; the path past
the pond ices over and people take the long way round. Boots with real tread
matter more here than any other equipment. Paths are cleared by 7am on weekdays
and considerably later at weekends.

The Kestrelford approach road is not gritted above the second village and is
impassable in snow, which can cut the town off for a day or two most winters.

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**

**Answer:**

```
```

**My relevance cutoff:**

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

     Milestone 4. -->

| Question | In corpus? | Best distance |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
